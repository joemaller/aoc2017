# [Advent of Code 2017][aoc2017] 

### December 2017

My solutions for this year using JavaScript (node.js). Each day's input and solutions are in labeled directories. Initially I'm expecting each day to include a module with functional code and a test.js file which actually runs the code. There's also a top-level package.json file for modules and boilerplate. 

AoC is also a great opportunity to learn something new. This year I've got too much going on to realistically tackle a new language, but there are a few things I'm trying:

1. I'm using [AVA test runner][ava] to check my results. The shape of these challenges fits well with a unit test framework, and this is a good opportunity to work on better practices. I've never used AVA, so let's see what happens. 

2. The bulk of this year's challenges will be written on a 2017 MacBook I borrowed from work. The little one (12-inch) with the keyboard I don't love. So far, it's been fine. The screen is nice (thanks to [QuickRes][]), the computer is plenty fast for simple scripts, Git and web browsing and the the battery is phenomenal. The keyboard however is really proving to be a bit of an issue for me -- my typing is significantly worse on this.  

The package.json file uses two commands: 

* `npm start` - Watches files and runs the test suite when files change
* `npm test` - Just runs the test suite
