# [Advent of Code 2017][aoc2017] 

### December 1, 2017

My solutions for this year using JavaScript (node.js). Each day's input and solutions are in labeled directories. Initially I'm expecting each day to include a module with functional code and a test.js file which actually runs the code. There's also a top-level package.json file for modules and boilerplate. 

I'm using two commands: 

* `npm start` - Watches files and runs the test suite when files change
* `npm test` - Just runs the test suite

AoC is also a great opportunity to learn something new. This year I've got too much going on to reslstically tackle a new langauge, but there are a few things I'm trying:

1. I will be using [AVA test runner][ava] to check my results. The shape of these challenges fits well with a unit test framework, and this is a good opportunity to work on better practices. I've never used Ava, so let's see what happens. 

2. I'm going to do the bulk of this year's challenges on a 2017 MacBook I borrowed from work. The little one (12-inch) with the keyboard I don't love. So far, it's been fine. the screen is nice (thanks to [QuickRes][]), the computer is plenty fast for simple scripts, Git and web browsing, but the keyboard really is proving to be a bit of an issue for me -- my typing is significantly worse on this.
