# [Day 1 Inverse Captcha][day1]

``` text
The captcha requires you to review a sequence of digits (your puzzle input)
and find the sum of all digits that match the next digit in the list. The
list is circular, so the digit after the last digit is the first digit in
the list.

For example:

  - 1122 produces a sum of 3 (1 + 2) because the first digit (1) matches
    the second digit and the third digit (2) matches the fourth digit.
  - 1111 produces 4 because each digit (all 1) matches the next.
  - 1234 produces 0 because no digit matches the next.
  - 91212129 produces 9 because the only digit that matches the next one
    is the last digit, 9.
```

Part one is a pretty straightforward filter-reduce problem. First, filter the input digits down to only those matching the next digit. Then sum that list. Out of curiosity I did it twice, once as a discrete filter with a simple sum reduce, then as a single reduce. The single reduce step was about 10% faster, though that was only about 50 Î¼s.
